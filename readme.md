# Traveling Salesman Problem
This software is created alongside a written analysis with the intention of critically examining all aspects of the Traveling Salesman problem (TSP). The TSP is an NP-hard problem. Further documentation of this problem can be found in the related documentation in the paper. This software uses the GLUT framework and therefore can only be ran on a Mac computer.

**Before Compiling**
- Make sure all source files are in the same folder
- Open the terminal
- Change directory to the src folder

**Compiling**
- Ensure you have a compiler (for the following I used cygwin)
- Compile by typing into the command line:
`g++ -framework OpenGL -framework GLUT -o ..\build\TSP main.cpp TSP.cpp`

**Running**
- Go to the build folder and double click on TSP.exe
or
- Change the terminal's current directory to the build folder and type ./TSP

**Initial Setup**
Once the program is running right click the screen to run the desired parts of the program.
